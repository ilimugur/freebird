# Free Bird

Free Bird is a hypercasual mobile game developed during the [Game Jam 06](https://goodgamers.biz/events/magiclab-and-good-job-games-invite-developers-to-gamejam06/), organized by [Good Job Games](https://www.goodjobgames.com/) in November 2019. The user navigates an airplane gliding through the sky, picking up fuel barrels and getting extra points for performing acrobatic feats, which include picking up a crew member which falls down from the plane when it is upside down.

The game is developed using Unity and C#.
